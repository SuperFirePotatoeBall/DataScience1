        HOLLYWOOD'S GENDER DIVIDE AND ITS EFFECTS ON FILM
    </h1>
    <h4 style="text-align: center; color: green;">
        EXAMINING THE GENDER OF WRITERS, PRODUCERS, AND DIRECTORS WHO MAKE FILMS THAT FAIL THE BECHDEL TEST
    </h4>
    <p> There's this thing called the Bechdel Test. It muesures just how male-dominated out beloved Netflix nights really are. To pass, films needs to satisfy three requirements:
    <p style="text-align: center;"> <b> 1. It has at least two women in it </b> </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"> <b> 2. Who talk to each other, about </b> </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"> <b> 3. Something other than men </b> </p>
    <p> It's a low bar, but many good movies don't pass. <i> Birdman </i> fails. <i> Avatar </i> fails. Fucking <i> Toy Story fails </i>. On <a href="https://bechdeltest.com/">Bechdeltest.com</a>, a site for crowdsourcing Bechdel Test results, about <b> 40% </b> of films don't pass. It's a sad state since women exist in life, like, half the time. </p>
    <p> Why? Rather than generalize a sexist system, oen theory is simple: filmmakers, unintentionally, ame movies about themselves (i.e., write wgat you know). Since the most powerful producers, writers, and directors are men, male themes permeate into hollywood's output. To see if women are more likely to write about women (i.e., pass the Bechdel test), we compiled the genders of the producers, writers, and directors on thousands of films. </p>
