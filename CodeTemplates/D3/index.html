    If you’re looking to add a new furry friend to your family, you may be encouraged to “adopt not shop”. That is, to
    find a new dog at a local shelter or rescue organization rather than a pet store or breeder.

  <div class="dropdown">
    <select id="myDropdown" class="dropbtn" onchange="changeContent()">
      <option value="Alabama">Alabama</option>
      <option value="California">California</option>
      <option value="Colorado">Colorado</option>
      
    </select>
  </div>
